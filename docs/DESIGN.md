## Visual Philosophy
The design follows an **Industrial Brutalist / Raw Engineering** aesthetic. It uses a high-contrast foundation (Pure White vs. Slate-900) with "Industrial Orange" (Orange-500) as the primary disruption color, focusing on heavy borders and bold typography.

## Design Patterns
-   **Brutalist Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred offsets for buttons and cards (Brutalist Shadow-Small/Large).
-   **Edge Borders**: Thick 4px - 8px Slate-900 boundaries for all primary layout containers.
-   **Aggressive Rotation**: Subtle counter-rotations (-6 to 3 degrees) for brand elements to simulate "Drafting" aesthetics.
-   **Typographic Hierarchy**: Heavy black weights (900+) for headings combined with medium 500-weight body text for maximum scannability.

## Color Palette
-   **Foundation**: Ceramic White (#ffffff)
-   **Structural Core**: Slate-900 (#0f172a)
-   **Industrial Primary**: Orange-500 (#f97316)
-   **Shadow Contrast**: Orange-600/700 for depth simulation.

## Interaction Design
-   **Dispatch Reveals**: Slide-and-fade motions for card entries using AnimatePresence.
-   **Industrial Toggles**: Immediate state-switching with heavy outline changes for interactive elements.
-   **Tactile Active States**: 95% scaling on brutalist buttons with shadow-compression effects.
