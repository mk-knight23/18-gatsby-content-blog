# Architecture: 18-gatsby-content-blog

## Overview
A high-fidelity technical manifesto and blog built with React 19 and Vite 6. Designed with an "Industrial Brutalist" philosophy, it prioritizes content density, high-contrast visual hierarchies, and extreme edge-first rendering principles.

## Tech Stack
-   **Framework**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

## Core Logic
-   **Dispatch System**: Reactive content grid for managing "Dispatches" (blog posts) with brutalist interaction patterns.
-   **Industrial Nav**: High-contrast, sticky navigation layer with modular status indicators.
-   **Manifesto Engine**: Specialized hero orchestration for communicating technical philosophies.
-   **Laboratory Layouts**: Modular grid systems (1x2, 1x4) for experimental content categorization.

## Performance
-   Zero-hydration-lag rendering via React 19.
-   Extreme CSS optimization using Tailwind v4 native engine.
-   Brutalist shadow-casting logic moved to hardware-accelerated composite layers for 60fps scrolling.
